# envgen schema (v2)
#
# Next steps:
# 1. Update metadata.destination to match where you want env files written.
# 2. Fill in environments.* values (used by {placeholders} in command sources).
# 3. Add sources and variables for your project.
# 4. Run: envgen pull --config env.dev.yaml --env dev --interactive
#
# This file includes inline comments explaining common fields. Remove or edit them as you like.

schema_version: "2"

metadata:
  # Human-readable description. Used in list output and docs.
  description: "Sample envgen schema. Replace with your project description."
  # Destination .env paths per environment.
  destination:
    local: ".env.local"
    dev: ".env.dev"
    stg: ".env.stg"
    prod: ".env.prod"

environments:
  # Free-form per-environment config. These keys can be referenced by {placeholders}
  # in source commands (e.g., {app_slug}).
  local:
    app_slug: "envgen-demo"
  dev:
    app_slug: "envgen-demo"
  stg:
    app_slug: "envgen-demo"
  prod:
    app_slug: "envgen-demo"

sources:
  # Source names are identifiers you choose. "command_name" is not a reserved keyword.
  command_name:
    # Commands can reference {key}, {environment}, and environment config keys like {app_slug}.
    command: "bash -lc 'echo {app_slug}-{environment}-{key}-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)'"

variables:
  # Each variable needs a description and a source.
  #
  # Common optional fields:
  # - sensitive: true|false (defaults to true; controls masking in output)
  # - source_instructions: shown for manual sources to help people find the value (supports multi-line with |)
  # - notes: free-form metadata for humans
  # - environments: limit a variable to specific environments
  # - resolvers: (schema v2) pick different sources per environment

  APP_NAME:
    description: "App display name (example of a static variable)."
    sensitive: false
    source: static
    values:
      local: "Envgen Local"
      dev: "Envgen Dev"
      stg: "Envgen Stg"
      prod: "Envgen Prod"

  API_TOKEN:

    source: manual
    source_instructions: |
      Example (GitHub fine-grained personal access token):
      1) Go to https://github.com and sign in.
      2) Click your avatar (top-right) -> Settings.
      3) Scroll to the bottom of the left sidebar -> Developer settings.
      4) Personal access tokens -> Fine-grained tokens -> Generate new token.
      5) Set an expiration date, limit repository access, and grant least-privilege permissions.
      6) Click Generate token and copy it immediately (you won't be able to see it again).
      7) Paste the token here when prompted by envgen.
      Tip: Store it in a password manager and rotate it regularly.
    notes: "Rotate quarterly."

  BUILD_ID:
